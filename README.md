# angular-spinners

See original documentation [here](https://github.com/Chevtek/angular-spinners/blob/master/README.md)

This fork is simply to convert this spinner module to be an angular component using the [AngularJS code standards created](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md) by John Papa

Also The module has been changed to use a simple CSS3 animation.
